# FLYR Web Development Technical Test ‚úàÔ∏è

This repository contains my solution for the FLYR web development technical test. Here you will find information about the project and how to run it. üöÄ

## Project Description üìã

The test involves creating the markup for the proposed design primarily in HTML5, SASS, and on an Angular project. It is focused on evaluating the detail and usability of the implementation, as well as assessing proficiency and knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and foundational skills in Angular. üñ•Ô∏è

## Requirements üì¶

- The mockup construction should be done within an Angular project.
- Creation of the mockup structure using Angular components.
- Styles implemented in SASS.
- Avoid using libraries for the layout, such as Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.
- It should be responsive (consider both mobile and desktop designs).
- Implementation of the functionality to open and close the menu (refer to the prototype).
- Use the Roboto font as specified.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Node.js is required to run Angular.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): npm comes bundled with Node.js and is used to manage project dependencies.
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/): Install Angular CLI globally for easier project management.
